# About Me

<img src="{{ "/assets/images/grenoble.jpg" }}" style="margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px" width="40%" align="right">

I live in the french Alpes, nearby Grenoble.

I am CTO in a big company, specialist in Energy Management and Automation.

I am engineer by education and a husband, a father (3 children), an athlete (running, cycling) and a maker by heart and passion.
Making digital products or software on my own has always been a hobby. I like creating or simply customizing things. 
I started programming in Basic when I was 10 years old, although my parents or relatives were far from this universe. Self-learning in the 80's / early 90's was not as easy as it is today. I was reading books, user manuals, but facing difficulties to find answers and improving. Internet has changed our life with an unbelievable access to knowledge.

This blog simply aims at sharing what I do, and hopefully someone will enjoy, reuse it, and adapt to its needs. 
This is a humble contribution to this fantastic knowledge base, the world wide web.
