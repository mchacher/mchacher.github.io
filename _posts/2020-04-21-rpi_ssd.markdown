## Why running on SSD?

SD Cards are not reliable enough to safely run you RPI. The lifetime of Flash cards is limited by the maximum number of writes per memory cell. A flash card has an on-card memory controller that performs wear leveling management. This tries to spread write actions over all memory cells - through time - evenly, to prevent premature partial wear out. The wear levelling unfortunately does not completely prevent microSD cards in Raspberry Piâ€™s (and similar devices) from wearing out.

SSD are showing far much greater performances. Some tests on the net are showing a factor of 3 to 5  (read/write) performance.

## How?

### Type of SSD

I like to use tiny mSATA SSD that I buy for a less than 30$.
Transfering an existing SD Cards Raspbian and associated application to the SSD is a piece of cake, and it has been greatly automated.

### Identifying your SSD

Your SSD should be on `/dev/sda`. 
You can further check it using 

    $ lsblk

### Stopping critical services

To avoid any issues during cloning, I invite you to stop all critical services / applicatins running on you Pi.
* Identify running services: `systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled`
* Stopping enabled services: `stop systemctl stop application.service`, where application is the name of your service.

### Using rpi-clone

[rpi-clone][rpi-clone] is a magic shell script that does everything for you.

Follow the steps:

#1 - download and install rpi-clone

    $ git clone https://github.com/billw2/rpi-clone.git 
	$ cd rpi-clone
	$ sudo cp rpi-clone rpi-clone-setup /usr/local/sbin

#2 - Prepare your clone with the right hostname
rpi-clone-setup is for setting the hostname in /etc/hostname and /etc/hosts files. It is run automatically by rpi-clone if -s args are given, but before your first clone using a -s option, test run rpi-clone-setup with:

    `$ sudo rpi-clone-setup -t testhostname`

#3 - Clone your SD card to USB disk, and tell the SD card to boot from disk:
If fstab uses PARTUUID:

	$ rpi-clone -l sda

If fstab uses device names:

	$ rpi-clone -l sda -e sda

To check your fstab file just look at it and check whether it is using PARTUUID or device names.

    $ cat /etc/fstab

As such the SD Card will only be used to tell the pi to boot from disk.

#4 - if you are using an pi3 you can tell him to boot from SSD only. This is not possible on pi4 at the time I am writing this article.

I let you read the process on other web sites.
