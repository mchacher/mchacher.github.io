## Why running on SSD?

SD Cards are not reliable enough to safely run you RPI. The lifetime of Flash cards is limited by the maximum number of writes per memory cell. A flash card has an on-card memory controller that performs wear leveling management. This tries to spread write actions over all memory cells - through time - evenly, to prevent premature partial wear out. The wear levelling unfortunately does not completely prevent microSD cards in Raspberry Pi’s (and similar devices) from wearing out.

SSD are showing far much greater performances. Some tests on the net are showing a factor of 3 to 5  (read/write) performance.

## How?

### Type of SSD

I like to use tiny mSATA SSD that I buy for a less than 30$.
Transfering an existing SD Cards Raspbian and associated application to the SSD is a piece of cake, and it has been greatly automated.

### Identifying your SSD

Your SSD should be on `/dev/sda`. 
You can further check it using `lsblk`.

### Stopping critical services

To avoid any issues during cloning, I invite you to stop all critical services / applicatins running on you Pi.
    Identify running services: `systemctl list-unit-files | grep enabled`
    Stopping enabled services: `stop systemctl stop application.service`, where application is the name of your service

### Using rpi-clone

[rpi-clone][rpi-clone] is a magic shell script that does everything for you.

Follow the steps:
    download and install rpi-clone
    `
    $ git clone https://github.com/billw2/rpi-clone.git 
	$ cd rpi-clone
	$ sudo cp rpi-clone rpi-clone-setup /usr/local/sbin
    `
