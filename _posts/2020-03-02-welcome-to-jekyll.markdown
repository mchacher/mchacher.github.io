I was looking for a solution to build a personnal website when I decided to launch Geekify.

I used to design websites on my own a couple of years ago but this time I wanted to leverage a more "ready-to-use" solution. I used to have a small experience with blog / CMS platforms, namely [dotclear](http://kramdown.gettalong.org) and [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/).  These platforms are good, but way too much over-engineered for a simple blog like this one (database required, user management, etc ...). Looking at some alternatives, the concept of static websites generator was quite interesting, and so I decided to give a try to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

## Static Web Site Generator

### Static vs. Dynamic

A static web page is delivered to the user's web browser exactly as stored, in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application. A static website generator is doing all the magic to build a full website. In short, most of them takes a directory filled with text files edited in Markdown, renders that content with layouts / templates and generates a publish-ready static website.

### Jekyll

Geekify site is built using Jekyll, and I am using the theme Minimal Mistakes. 
Jekyll is defined as a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. 
I decided to use Jekyll, since it is the generator used by Github and anyone can use it to host its website. I will explain the principles later in this documen
