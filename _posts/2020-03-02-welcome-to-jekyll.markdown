I learned a lot while building this website; I hope to share it so that it might be
helpful for anyone trying to do the same. I'm sure you'll notice that I'm far from an
expert in the subjects we're going to explore here; this is my first foray into static web site generation.
If you have any corrections, or things I've misunderstood, I'd love to hear about it! Just post a comment.

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites.
